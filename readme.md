## Asteroids ##

My version of the game Asteroids using the Python Pygame library. In addition to the expected gameplay, this version includes a tactical map overlay that shows the position of all of the asteroids on the map. The ship also includes an area-affect "Deathblossom" weapon that destroys any asteroid in range.

*Controls*
* <Right Arrow> - Rotate right
* <Left Arrow> - Rotate left
* <Left Shift> - Thrust
* <Spacebar> - Fire
* <d> - "Deathblossom" area-affect weapon destroys asteroids in radius of effect
